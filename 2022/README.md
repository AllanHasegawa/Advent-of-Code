# Advent of Code 2022 (Go/Kotlin Edition)

This year I initially chose Go so I could learn the language. Unfortunately Go never clicked with me. It felt just a "different" C, but not better enough to justify it existing, at least for this type of problem. I endured until day 19, but day 19 was tough by itself, so decided to switch to a language I'm more comfortable, Kotlin.

So enjoy this mixed AoC run :)

## Running the solutions in Go

```shell
$ cd day1
$ go run .
```

## Running the solutions in Kotlin

```shell
Easier to open it in Intellij and run it ;)
```
