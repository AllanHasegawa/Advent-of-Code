# Advent of Code

Archive for my Advent of Code runs.


## Years

* 2021: **Haskell**. Had an amazing run with Haskell. The language worked surprisingly well for almost all problems. Some problems were beautiful and was coded like a brute-force approach, but Haskell memoization "fixed" it. Had a few complications when trying to multi-thread some problems though. Overall, awesome language. Unfortunately I can't find the archive for it.
* 2022: **Go/Kotlin**. Go didn't work for me. Just a "different" C, but not significantly better. Ended up switching to Kotlin after day 19. Kotlin is amazing though, the kind of language that helps you and doesn't get in the way.
* 2023: TODO
